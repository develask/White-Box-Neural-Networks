# White Box Neural Networks

This tookit is the result of two Master thesis, and is still under development. For the moment standard multilayer neural networks have been developed, as well as networks with paralell connections and recurrent neural netoworks, LSTMs included.

See our wiki: [link](https://github.com/develask/White-Box-Neural-Networks/wiki)

Next steps:

- [X] Minibatching
- [ ] Modify the softmax activation function
- [ ] Add covolution layer
- [X] Change the shape order of inputs: (examples, feats)
- [ ] Change the order of inputs and time
- [ ] Generalize for more kind of networks
